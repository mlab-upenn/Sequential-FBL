# Sequential-FBL
Requirements: MPT 3.+ toolbox: http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~mpt/3/ CVX: http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/ Casadi MATLAB: https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/matlab HSL routines for ipopt (optional, to get best performance): http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt/

Please run Mission_Gui for Sequential Method. Mission_Gui_1 is for anotehr Signal Temporal Logic(eventually -> always)

If you want to see relevant functions, they are in CaseStudy file with _seq

You can change the logic to (eventually -> always) under sequential method by directing subfunctions to robustness_goal_ea_al.
